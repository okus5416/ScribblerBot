## Current state

The web application is mostly finished. If any changes need to be made to the client, I (Mitchell) will make them. I have also completed the obstacle avoidance program. I also plan to do most of the coding for the real part of the project, since I know Python. There are six roles, indicated in bold, for the six other team members.

## Descriptions

### UI designer

The project will require some additional user interface (beyond what's already in the template). The UI designer will do some drawings and come up with the best design. He will then implement it in HTML and CSS.

### Algorithm developer

The algorithm developer must devise an algorithm that takes the users input it its raw form and uses it to perform the desired actions. He might want to sketch out the idea with a flowchart or pseudocode first. He will then implement it in Python.

### Documenter

The documenter will ensure that there everything is perfectly documented. Every function must have an up-to-date docstring, and in some cases they will have to be rewritten. In addition, the documenter will track our progress and keep notes. He will give the information he collects to the reporters when the time comes to write the report.

### Reporter (requirements)

The report seems like it will involve quite a bit of work, so two people will be responsible for writing it. The first reporter can just do the requirements section.

### Reporter (the rest)

The second reporter will write the rest of the report. The reporters can decide on a different way to split up the work if they like.

### Manager

The manager must check up on all the team members fairly often and make sure that progress is being made (in other words, that people aren't slacking off). He should spend a fair amount of time on the Trello boards, figuring out what is already done and what needs to be done. (For that matter, the manager should make sure that all other team members are _on_ Trello to begin with.) If a team member has a problem, the manager should direct them to someone who can help them with it. The manager will also organize team meetings.
